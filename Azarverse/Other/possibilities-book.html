        <h2>What if Voidzarus was actually a good person? </h2>
        <p>For starters, this is impossible. Voidzarus is a being made of pure evil. He will never be good. Now, if he was actually good, Azarus would have never left his universe. Azarus would have never met A.Z.A.R.U.S. The Azarus Association would have never been created. Lazarus would have never left his universe in pursuit of Voidzarus. And Voidzarus would have tried to return to his universe, or at least close the rift that was created there. All the universes would have been uncommunicated for a long time. A very, very long time. The future would have been so... different that I wouldn't be writing the Azarchives if nothing bad had happened.</p>
        <h2>What if A.Z.A.R.U.S. was the bad guy? </h2>
        <p>A.Z.A.R.U.S. is one of the most dangerous Azaruses out there. Luckily, he is friendly and mostly pacific. But what if he wasn't? What if he was a demonic being out of control? Well, he's able to survive harsh environments, he can withstand extreme weather conditions, and on top of that, he's an extremely skilled fighter. His extra eyes allow him to have better knowledge of the surroundings and tracking his opponents. If he is the bad guy in the story, he is to be feared. He's not capable of reality bending or creating rifts, but he certainly has the potential of creating a device that does just that. In this case, he would would be able to destroy part of the universe. Too bad Archive β is here to save us from impending doom.</p>
        <h2>Voidzarus VS Lazarus </h2>
        <p>It is hard to know for certain who would win, but the destruction it'd cause would be devastating. Not only are both of them mighty powerful, they have their unique abilities. Lazarus, as the only son of a long forgotten abyssal family that lived in the surface, has the advantage in close combat, as well as casting verbal curses that restrict the enemy's movements. Then there's Voidzarus, also known as the Bread Diety, has the upper hand in magic at long and short distances. He's also capable of shape-shifting and influencing people's minds. In the end, the only possible way to know is to make them fight. Although that should never happen...</p>
        <h2>Bweeswees x Azarus - Part 1 </h2>
        <p>This event is not canon, and never will be. Now that you've been warned, let me show you what degeneracy can produce out of a single image.<br><br>It was a normal day in Azarus's life. He was about to head to school after having breakfast when he tripped. But not only did he trip, he went through a rift that opened up on the floor. When he opened his eyes, he found himself somewhere different. It was more... green, and full of trees that blocked some of the sunlight from reaching the ground. His first reaction was obviously extreme confusion, but he knew that wouldn't help. So he calmed himself and pulled up his phone, opening Google Maps. It was to no avail, though. The app couldn't geolocate him. He was starting to become desperate, searching for an app in his phone that would get him out of there. That's when he started hearing footsteps near him. He spoke:<br><br>— Hello? <br><br>The footsteps stopped for a second, and then started to become louder as whoever was there walked in his direction. He could eventually see the figure of what looked like a girl walking towards him. As that figure approached, her features became clearer.<br><br>Her appearance was unique. The shape of a woman, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">with a pair of big juicy melons,</span> but the features of a bee: 4 wings and a stinger, as well as some mustard yellow fur covering her skin. It was truly a sight worth to behold. <br><br>— Hey! — The bee hybrid smiled. — Are you lost?<br><br>Azarus took a few extra seconds to reply, for his mind and sight were occupied processing who this person was.<br><br>— A- Ah, yeah. I just appeared here out of nowhere. It happens more often than you think.<br><br>— So... you unwillingly teleport to random places at random times and you can't stop it? — Said the woman. She looked at him, apparently suspicious of his words.<br><br>— Yeah... it's hard to explain why this happens. — Azarus spoke, trying to act as natural as possible.<br><br>— I see... so if by the time we get out of the forest you haven't disappeared, will you explain in better detail why you have that condition?<br><br>— Yeah, I suppose I could do that. <br><br>— Alright — she said looking satisfied by that answer — follow me.</p>
        <h2>Bweeswees x Azarus - Part 2 </h2>
        <p>Azarus followed her around the forest without any doubts. He wasn't conscious but there was something about this woman that drew him towards her. Maybe it was her unique scent that reminded him of honey? <br><br>— The name's Bweeswees, by the way — she said, still walking.<br><br>— Ah- they call me Azarus. Nice to meet you — he replied, taken by surprise.<br><br>— Azarus, huh? — Before she says anything else, they saw the end of the forest, which led to a normal city street. — Hey, look! That's the end of the forest!<br><br>Bweeswees started to walk faster, and so did Azarus, who was behind her. Finally, they both got outside the forest. They looked at each other with a smile on their faces. They had finally made it out! Azarus looked around in satisfaction, which didn't last long, because it soon converted to confusion.<br><br>— So uhh… remember when I said that I teleport to random places? — Azarus asked, with a bit of concern in his tone.<br><br>— Yeah. Are you gonna explain? — She looked expectant of an answer that pleased her.<br><br>— Before that, do you mind telling me where we are?<br><br>— You don't know where you are, do you?<br><br>— Uhh… no. — Azarus looked down, lightly embarrassed by the situation.<br><br>Bweeswees chuckled from his response.<br><br>— We're in Vallindale, Cavara, USA.<br><br>After hearing that, Azarus's face went pale. He finally realised where he was: in a different universe. That sudden realisation made the world still for what felt like minutes for him.<br><br>— Oh, no. — He whispered, in an almost inaudible voice.<br><br>— Hey,&nbsp;are you ok? You need water or something? — She asked, concerned about his well-being.<br><br>— Uhh… — He finally came to his senses — Yeah- I mean no. I'm alright. I was just thinking of something.<br><br>— Ah. Are you sure you don't want to rest for a bit?<br><br>— Actually, I think I might have to sit down for a moment. I need to think about some things.<br><br>— My flat is nearby. We could go there if you don't mind.<br><br>— Are you sure? I don't want to bother you for so long.<br><br>— Nah, don't worry. It's alright. — She smiled<br><br>— Well, if you say so, I guess we can go to your flat.<br><br>Deep inside Bweeswees, she felt a wave of happiness that he agreed to spend some time in the privacy of her home.</p>
        <h2>Bweeswees x Azarus - Part 3 </h2>
        <p>They arrived to Bweeswees's flat. It was rather simple, without much going on, but a place to call home. She sat Azarus in te couch for him to rest and process whatever he had inside his now troubled mind.<br><br>— I know we met today, but if something is bothering you, you can always tell me. I will help if I can — she offered her support, because even if they recently met, helping someone recover their mental stability is more important (I hope you do the same, reader. Mental health is no joke).<br><br>— I just… realized something important, when you told me the name of this city — He replied.<br><br>— Did you… travel to another country? — She asked in a try to guess what he meant.<br><br>— No, it's not that. I haven't left my country.<br><br>— Then what could it be?<br><br>— I… I traveled to a different universe.<br><br>— Huh? — She didn't really know what he meant by that. Was he really from another universe?<br><br>— Yeah, I was just as confused as you at first. Mostly because it never happened before.<br><br>— So you come from another universe, you randomly teleport, and never before have you traveled to another universe?<br><br>— Yeah, that's pretty much it — He made a long pause, thinking of what to say next, and then he finally spoke — The bad part is that I don't know if I'll be able to return because, well, I've never experienced this.<br><br>— That must be real hard, to not know if you'll ever return home. — She put her hand on his shoulder and smiled — But hey, at least you already have one friend.<br><br>— Yeah… at least I have you.<br><br>Deep within Bweeswees's heart, that sentence caused a wave of unprecedented emotions that she wasn't even aware of. But she didn't notice, or acted as if she didn't know.<br><br>— I think I'll rest for a bit now, if you don't mind — It was clear in Azarus's eyes that he really needed to rest his troubled mind.<br><br>— Oh- yeah, alright — She stuttered, but finally managed to speak after being lost in her own thoughts.<br><br>Azarus lay down and closed his eyes, letting go of all the bad thoughts he had accumulated, remembering&nbsp;the not-so-past words of Bweeswees saying that he at least had one friend.</p>
        <h2>Bweeswees x Azarus - Part 4</h2>
        <p>After half an hour or so of sound sleeping, Azarus woke up to the same sight he had closed his eyes to. It wasn't a dream, after all. It was real. He had traveled to another universe. He was lost in a strange place.<br><br>— Hey, how do you feel? — He heard a strange yet familiar voice.<br><br>Who could that be? He tilted his head to face the source of the voice and there she was. Bweeswees, the only person he (quite literally) knew in the entire world. He was still half asleep and she could tell by his zombie expression. After he was done processing all the information as slow as an old internet modem, he finally spoke.<br><br>— Oh, yeah. I feel better. Thanks for letting me take a nap.<br><br>— Don't think too much about it. I was only trying to help. — The smile on her face never disappeared from her lips. — You know… — She looked down, avoiding eye contact while her face turned red — …you can stay at my place for as long as you want.<br><br>— Oh... are you sure?<br><br>— Y- yeah. I don't mind having you here. — A great lie even she didn't believe.<br><br>The stomach of Bweeswees growled, which she covered with her arms and an embarrassed smile.<br><br>— I think you should eat something. — Azarus commented.<br><br>— I was… waiting for you to wake up.<br><br>— Then why didn't you wake me up?<br><br>— You were sleeping so peacefully that I couldn't bear interrupting your sleep. — She replied blushing.<br><br>Internally, she thought "He was so cute during his sleep though…". Which unintentionally made her blush even more.<br><br>— …are you ok? — Her face was so red that Azarus thought that she had a fever.<br><br>— N- no. I- I'm fine.<br><br>— Are you sure?<br><br>— Yeah?<br><br>— Hmmm… alright.</p>
