        <h1 class="text-center">Entity group NaN - Elevated entities</h1>
        <p>These entities all follow the same pattern, but it is unclear why they exist, and why they spontaneously create universes.</p>
        <h2>Codename: Dionysus</h2>
        <p>There are certain universes that follow a known pattern. They part from already existing universes but they have certain differences with the originals. For example, we found a universe where A.Z.A.R.U.S. became the bread diety instead of Subject 000. We currently don't know the reason behind the universes created by this entity.</p>
        <h2>Codename: Toons</h2>
        <p>There have been reports of universes being born every week or so. They are replicas of already existing universes, but the living beings in there have different physical properties. The most characteristic property that's common in all these universes is that they look as if they were drawn.</p>
        <h2>Codename: Innocence</h2>
        <p>During constant surveillance of the Toons constellation's work, one of our workers spotted a new universe forming. That universe was completely unique and with a totally different <em>style</em>, so the researchers decided to create a new constellation in their records.<br><br>Its universe feels too complex for it to be classified as Toons, and its <em>style</em> too different to be Dionysus. We don't know much yet, but the fact that it created the Cult Of Flower poses a risk to the Association in the foreseeable future. Other team members will monitor its development.</p>
