        <p>The Diety of Flour descended upon the universe. To prevent the calamity, he had to make the world anew. To his image, free of evil.<br><br>Lazarus rejected this diety's promises, and made a deal with the Bread Diety. To be freed once their common enemy was defeated. He was powerful, as expected as the harbinger of destruction. But he didn't expect the Diety of Flour to be an actual god. No one did. Omnipotence at its finest. He managed to contain the Diety as well as himself inside a "Void". Lazarus thought that would stop both of them from destroying the world. That's what he believed would happen.<br><br>But the Diety escaped. His roots started invading the world. The desperation started building up inside him. He made a desperate attempt at protecting this timeline, resetting everything back to where it was a few months ago. Without this Diety. But it didn't work. Not even corrupting the timeline worked. This Diety was truly omnipotent. He... won. The Diety of Flour reshaped the world. Made it be reborn. Now without evil.<br><br>I had to descend to their realm. A world that lost all balance was doomed to be forgotten. And I didn't want that to happen. I only had one universe die, and I didn't want another to meet the same fate. He refused. This supposed "angel" refused my offer to let the world live. He'd rather let the world die without a speck of evil than letting it live and have evil in it.&nbsp;<br><br>Then so be it. Let the world be forgotten. Let it rot away in a corner. Forgotten by all who had any kind of interest in this timeline. All because of his selfishness.</p>
