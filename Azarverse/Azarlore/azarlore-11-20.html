        <h2>Chapter 11 - Separated</h2>
        <p class="text-start">Azarus woke up with a headache. He was somehow sleeping on the ground. "Strange", he thought. He looked around, but to his surprise he found himself completely alone in a weird place. It was a flat surface with nothing but light fog and a greyish sky. He finally got up and started walking in a random direction.<br><br><em>Incredibly epic time skip because nothing happens in this part.</em><br><br>Azarus saw a small building in the distance, where he went to without thinking it twice. Upon getting closer, he saw it more clearly. It was a... train station? In the middle of nowhere? Why would someone want to place a building station in such a place? Utterly useless in my opinion.<br><br>When he got there, he saw A.Z.A.R.U.S. and Azy were already waiting in there. They waved their hands to greet him.<br><br>— We've been waiting for you. Where have you been? — Asked A.Z.A.R.U.S.<br><br>— I... don't know... — said Azarus — it's strange that we were separated.<br><br>— Yeah. I hope it doesn't happen again... — said Azy. It was clear that the idea of being close to A.Z.A.R.U.S wasn't of his liking.</p>
