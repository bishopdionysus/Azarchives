    <h1>The Azarverse: chapters 1-10</h1>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Chapter 1 - The Beginning</h2>
        <p class="text-start">It happened a long time ago. Azarus was a youtuber that used to upload Incredibox content. One day, a man in a suit came to his house to tell him something no one would have expected. <em>"You have been elected as a test subject for a top secret experiment."</em>, said the man. Azarus, with no idea of what the man was saying, politely told him to leave his house. But the man insisted, pointing at him with a gun. <em>"This is an offer you cannot refuse. Please come with us."</em>, said this man. Last thing Azarus saw was that gun before going blank. Someone knocked him out. <br><br>He later woke up in an empty room, with nothing but a wooden chair. Suddenly, a voice spoke: <em>"Thank you for your cooperation in the Breach Riding Experiment of Antiparticles and Decontamination. The project consists in you going through a spatial breach that suddenly opened in this planet. We guarantee your safety as long as you follow our instructions."</em> Then Azarus replied: <em>"Uhhhh... what was this thing called?"</em> The voice spoke again, saying <em>"In your pocket you will find a gadget with a circular shape. We want you to enter the spacial rift for one minute. You may enter the rift when the door opens. When you find yourself in the other side, take it out and let it do the work. If it is impossible for you to stay that long due to unforseen circumstances, you are allowed to return from where you entered. Leave the gadget in there if you cannot retrieve it."</em>&nbsp;Azarus simply nodded in agreement.<br><br>After a few seconds, a door opened in the wall, revealing a bright light. It was the rift the voice was talking about. Azarus hesitated for a moment, but he had no other choice so he gathered some courage, closed his eyes and entered the rift. After he entered, an alarm went off. The lights turned bright red. The rift begun to suck everything that was nearby. <em>"The rift is destabilizing!" "All systems are overheating!" "We need to close the rift immediately!"</em> As the last voice spoke, the rift collapsed. All that was left was an empty room, with no traces of Azarus. No one could locate him. Not even with the built-in geolocation system nor the subspacial detection was able to pinpoint his location. Why was he nowhere to be found? He couldn't have possibly traveled to another universe, had he?</p>

    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Chapter 2 - A New Universe</h2>
        <p class="text-start">Now you may be wondering "Where's Azarus? What happened to him?". Well, those questions can all be answered. <span style="color: rgb(39, 43, 48);">But before we begin this new chapter, let me tell you that casualities never happen.</span><br>Azarus woke up in what seemed to be a factory. It was really quiet. There was almost no light except for some small cracks in the ceiling letting through a bit of sunlight. The machinery was all rusty, almost like it wasn't used for a long time. Something quite obvious given that it was an abandoned factory. Do you remember the gadget that Azarus was given? Well, that thing left his pocket on its own and began floating in front of him. <em>"Woah!"</em> said Azarus in surprise. The gadget began to speak, glowing with a blue tint: <em>"Scanning the microwave background... Checked. Background does not match 001. Registering new universe '002 - Evacuate'... Done."</em>&nbsp;The object then fled towards Azarus's hand and spoke again: <em>"Registering DNA fingerprints of the new owner... Done. Welcome to the Fault Analysis and Universe Lithograph Tracer."</em> Azarus would have begun using his newly discovered piece of tech, but he heard the echo of someone's steps approaching. He had no time to waste, so he hid under some conveyor belts that had machines on both sides in such a way that he wouldn't be noticed unless someone were to directly look under the belt. And guess what happened. Someone looked under the belt. How predictable! In any case, whoever found him just said <em>"‚Ñ∏ Ã£ ‚çë‚ïé·ì≠ ‚ïé·ì≠ „É™ùôπ !¬°Íñé·îë·ìµ·í∑ ‚Ñ∏ Ã£ ùôπ ‚çë‚ïé‚Ü∏·í∑ ‚ïé‚éì ||ùôπ‚öç ‚à¥·îë„É™‚Ñ∏ Ã£&nbsp;‚Ñ∏ Ã£ ùôπ ·í∑·ì≠·ìµ·îë!¬°·í∑ ‚Ñ∏ Ã£ ‚çë·í∑ ‚éì·îë‚ïéÍñé·í∑‚Ü∏ ·í∑ Ãá/!¬°·í∑‚à∑‚ïé·í≤·í∑„É™‚Ñ∏ Ã£ ·ì≠"</em> Azarus, frightened, ran for his life towards the nearest door in his sight, which happened to be blocked. The creature was after him, but it somehow didn't look like it had the intention to kill him. Then, it cleared its throat and spoke again: <em>"I wouldn't go in there if you value your life.". "Wha-?"</em> Azarus couldn't even finish his sentence. <em>"It's full of monsters that will try to kill you the moment they see you. Also, I'm sorry for scaring you. I forgot how to properly speak after all this time being alone."</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Chapter 3 - He's not the only one</h2>
        <p class="text-start">Azarus used the FAULT's light to illuminate the surroundings, having a better view of whatever was standing in front of him. <em>"You're-... we-"</em> He was in shock. He couldn't move, and he could barely articulate any words. <em>"Yes. I'm you. We're the same person."</em> There he was, an Azarus from a different universe. The most notabe differences were that the new Azarus had a bandage covering his eyes, and that he was (literally) in black and white (just like in the old TVs). <em>"I will try to explain the situation as best as I can, but before that, we need to get to a safer place."</em> And just like that, the Azarus from a new universe took Azarus's hand and took him down a hall to a secluded room. <br><br>It was all clean and the air smelled fresh. The illumination was also just perfect to see everything. Azarus was given a chair to sit on and some water, then the other Azarus began to speak: <em>"So... you entered a dimensional rift and you somehow ended up in this universe. Apparently, there are many others like us, one in each universe.".</em>&nbsp;<em>"Uhhh... what?"</em>&nbsp;Said Azarus, confused. The other Azarus spoke agin: <em>"The thing you went through. It was a rift. It took you to another universe.".&nbsp;"Oh... OH!"</em>&nbsp;Azarus finally understood. <em>"The name's A.Z.A.R.U.S., by the way.". "Soo... A.Z.A.R.U.S... do you know how to get back to my universe?". "I'm sorry but I only know that much.". "Oh..."</em>&nbsp;Azarus looked down in disappointment. Luckily, the FAULT was there to save the day. It began floating between both Azaruses's faces and spoke: <em>"Spacetime anomaly detected at one kilometer from current location. Most likely a rift."</em> It then showed a hologram with a map, pointing at the approximate location of the rift. Azarus's eyes shined bright with hope, thinking that he would get back home. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Chapter 4 - This story needed some tension</h2>
        <p class="text-start">His hope wouldn't last much becuse at that precise moment both Azaruses heard a massive roar coming down the hallway.<br><br>‚Äî Oh no. ‚Äî Said A.Z.A.R.U.S.<br><br>‚Äî What was that? ‚Äî Asked Azarus, in a mix of fear and shock.<br><br>A.Z.A.R.U.S looked at the holographic map once again. They had to go north-west.<br><br>‚Äî We have no time. ‚Äî A.Z.A.R.U.S. replied, as he rushed towards a nearby control panel, pressing a button that closed an armored door in the hallway. ‚Äî We need to escape. The failures have escaped.<br><br>As he spoke, he grabbed Azarus's hand and ran through a door that led them outside the facilities.<br><br>‚Äî We only have a headstart. We better make use of it. ‚Äî Said A.Z.A.R.U.S.<br><br>Both of them were running towards the location of the rift when, after five minutes or so, they heard a loud noise coming from the facilities they escaped from. Azarus looked behind for a brief moment. He saw a huge cloud of smoke. A.Z.A.R.U.S spoke:<br><br>‚Äî That hopefully killed most of them, but it's possible that some were able to survive.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Chapter 5 - A battle against time</h2>
        <p class="text-start">They eventually got to the general location of the rift, but they still had to search for it. To make things worse, the remaining failures were after them. They had to hurry finding the rift if they didn't want to be eaten alive. They split and began searching for the rift. They were nervous. What if a beast comes out of nowhere and eats them? A.Z.A.R.U.S finally managed to find the rift, so he told Azarus to come his way to see it. Their happiness was cut short because of a little drawback: the beasts that were mere meters away from them.&nbsp;A.Z.A.R.U.S jumped, pushing Azarus and himself inside the rift. The rift immediately closed after them, not letting the failures come after them. <br><br>A.Z.A.R.U.S appeared in another universe after entering the rift. Azarus however... took some time to appear. It's unclear why, but he appeared in some sort of limbo. He couldn't move, see or hear anything. It was pure stillness in a space devoid of everything. A voice spoke, almost as if it was inside his head. <em>"Your journey has just begun. To return home, cross the Azarverse."</em>. And when Azarus blinked, he saw himself in another place, now with light. All his senses came back to him as soon as they went away.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Chapter 6 - Unexpected... growth?</h2>
        <p class="text-start">A.Z.A.R.U.S. was already doing a little exploration of the place they ended up in. It was apparently a crop field of some sort. Upon closer inspection, those crops were actually trees. This raised a question in his head: <em>"Why are these trees so small?"</em> It was a good question since the trees were just a few centimeters taller than A.Z.A.R.U.S. Azarus finally fell through the rift face first into the ground. The rift immediately closed behind him. They were stuck in this new universe. He stood up and looked around. When A.Z.A.R.U.S. saw him, he went to tell him everything he knew about this place, which wasn't much. Azarus looked at the place where the rift disappeared. <br><br>‚Äî Oh great. Now we can't come back. ‚Äî He said.<br><br>‚Äî Nah, don't worry. You know, that place was crap. That universe was doomed from the start anyway ‚Äî A.Z.A.R.U.S. replied<br><br>With nothing left to do but to explore, they decided to wander in a random direction.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Chapter 7 - Tiny problems</h2>
        <p class="text-start">After an hour or so of walking, they ended up finding nothing but more trees, or so they thought. A.Z.A.R.U.S. noticed that something was off. He felt something or someone watching them. He suddenly stopped.<br><br>‚Äî Don't move an inch. ‚Äî A.Z.A.R.U.S. said.<br><br>‚Äî Wha-? ‚Äî Said Azarus after stopping<br><br>‚Äî Don't even make a sound. I'm trying to concentrate. ‚Äî Said A.Z.A.R.U.S. while concentrating on pinpointing the creature's location.<br><br>After a few seconds, he finally looked at the direction of the thing that was watching them. Whatever it was, it ran away pretty fast.&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Chapter 8 - Azaruses of all heights</h2>
        <p class="text-start">A.Z.A.R.U.S. started running in pursue of that‚Ä¶ thing that was watching them. Even though it was fast and had the advantage of the terrain, enabling it to hide below the trees, its speed was no match for A.Z.A.R.U.S., who caught up to it in less than 2 minutes. A.Z.A.R.U.S. triumphantly grabbed what felt like one of its limbs and held it in the air like some sort of wild bird. <br><br>‚Äî Argh! Please let me go! I swear I don‚Äôt taste good! ‚Äî The creature shouted.<br><br>‚Äî What‚Äôs that? ‚Äî Asked Azarus in the distance. He didn‚Äôt want to run if it wasn‚Äôt necessary so he was calmly walking towards A.Z.A.R.U.S.<br><br>‚Äî It looks like some sort of tiny human ‚Äî Said A.Z.A.R.U.S. in response.<br><br>A.Z.A.R.U.S. could only see through smell and sound. Something like an echolocation of sorts. So he couldn‚Äôt really identify the looks of this tiny human until Azarus approached them and unexpectedly shouted in surprise:<br><br>‚Äî A.Z.A.R.U.S. let him go! He‚Äôs another Azarus!<br><br>‚Äî Oh. ‚Äî Said A.Z.A.R.U.S. after looking at it one final time before putting this tiny Azarus down in the ground once again.</p>

    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Chapter 9 - Tiny people for a tiny world</h2>
        <p class="text-start">Honestly, this part is the most boring one since there‚Äôs no action or something going on behind the scenes. I got bored after listening to these 3 Azaruses talking about uninteresting stuff for half an hour. They had a lot of time to spare and this world wasn‚Äôt dangerous at all (at least for the two big Azaruses). Azarus also decided to sleep for some time before resuming his adventure through the Azarverse. <br><br>Now that I more or less explained what happened, let‚Äôs continue with the interesting part.<br><br>After Azarus woke up, he saw the mini version of him on one side, hiding from A.Z.A.R.U.S. Thinking of it as odd, he asked why was he hiding from him. The mini Azarus said that the Azarus with the blindfold looked scary. Azarus, trying to comfort Azy (I call him that way so that I don‚Äôt confuse him with Azarus) told him that he didn‚Äôt have to worry, that he can look scary, but that he is nice. Azy didn‚Äôt know what to think, but chose to trust him.<br><br>Azarus grabbed the FAULT from his pocket and looked at it. It opened a map of the area, showing the direction to the exact position of the rift (and for those curious as to why it knows the exact location in this universe and not in the past one, the FAULT had hours to scan the entire planet, so it gave a more accurate reading).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Chapter 10 - Three party members</h2>
        <p class="text-start">These three Azaruses went towards where the rift was located. When they arrived there, Azarus stood in front of it and looked at Azy.<br><br>‚Äî Are you sure you want to leave your universe? I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll be able to return ‚Äî said Azarus.<br><br>‚Äî Yeah, sure. I don‚Äôt have much to do in this place anyway ‚Äî replied Azy.<br><br>‚Äî If that‚Äôs your final decision, let‚Äôs get going then.<br><br>Azarus, A.Z.A.R.U.S and Azy went through the portal, expectant of what universe they would visit. It all went black.<br><br>‚Ä¶<br>‚Ä¶<br><br>‚Äî New microwave background detected. Scanning‚Ä¶<br><br>‚Ä¶<br><br>‚Äî Successfully scanned. Universe 004 registered.</p>
