        <h2>Archive α - The Origin of a Diety</h2>
        <p class="text-start">After the war of Embers, a hole opened up in the ground. It led to the abyss. But what no one knows is that the catastrophe also created something worse. It agitated the spacetime tissue so much that it opened a crack. The first rift ever recorded in the history of the multiverse. But it didn't open in that universe. It instead opened up in the Void universe. Why? Quite simple really. It's the most vulnerable universe since reality broke apart. The thing is, there lived one of the many versions of Azarus. He was the worst of the worst. He seeked entertainment through the suffering of others. Definitely a man to be feared, and very powerful. He grew tired of his own universe so the moment he saw the spatial rift he knew it was the best opportunity to leave this world behind and expand his realm.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive β - Subject 002</h2>
        <p class="text-start"><strong>Appendix:</strong> All versions of the person named Azarus will be referred to as "Subject", followed by the ID of the universe they come from. <br>Subject 002 was one of the most dangerous beings in the universe because of his bloodthirst and expanded capabilities thanks to the ferofluid. We don't know what happened to him. When we discovered his existence, he was already a kind person. It's possible that something might have taken away his old personality, but... why? Subject 002 doesn't seem to remember anything, so that doesn't help either.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive γ - Rifts</h2>
        <p class="text-start">They are small cracks in the fabric of reality that connect universes. We don't know what caused them to appear, but it's possible that some sort of event caused them to appear in every universe. As of the time updating this archive, the investigation has reached the conclusion that these rifts only allow the many Azaruses to go through them. It has also concluded that something is making them. We still don't know who or what though.&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive δ - Failures from universe 002</h2>
        <p class="text-start">Not much is known about them. We managed to capture one of them. Unfortunately, they lack the ability to talk. Aside from that, something caught our attention. It contained p̸̴̠̘͓͉̫̈́͐́͐̕̚ᴉ̵̵̡̢̡̙̫͉̓̿̒̈́͌̕n̵̸͙̠̼̟͇͔̐͋̈́̿̕ʅ̵̵̡͔͍͉͕͔͛̿̒͐̚͝ⅎ̴̸̘̪̪͔̞͛̓͑̐̈́͠o̵̴̘͖̞͓͙̝͊̾̽͑͒̚ɹ̸̴̺͖̙̼͖̈́́̿͑̈́͆͜ǝ̵̴̡͔͔͎̟͉̽͒̿̿̕͠ⅎ̴̴͍̞̠͔͍̼̐͐̒͐̈́͝, which originated from another universe. We don't know how that substance ended up in there, but it definitely needs to be investigated.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive ε - Our organization</h2>
        <p class="text-start">This organization was made with the aim of containing every event or entity that would pose harm to the stability of the Azarverse. It was founded by the man of the universe from which the spacetime tissue was agitated violently that caused 0̴̵̶̷̢̡͔̘͇͌̒͆͠0̴̸̶̷̺̙̻͆͋͊̀͘̚͜0̸̴̶̷̻̝̼̼͍̘̈́͊̒̓͊̈́ to escape. Luckily, up to this date there have been no reports of multiversal instability. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive ζ - First sight of subject 001</h2>
        <p class="text-start">The first ever detection of subject 001 was when he crossed the rift in universe 004 that led to universe 005. We have been monitoring his every move ever since then. His existence has caused quite a stir in the multiversal fabric, but it's nothing that can pose harm to reality. Because of that, we haven't restricted his moves (yet).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive η - The FAULT</h2>
        <p class="text-start">This device has been both hardware and software locked to only work with subject 001. We do not know why the manufacturer made it so secure, but we have an understanding of what it does. It basically scans the microwave background of the current universe and if it doesn't match the backgrounds in its database, it registers it as a new universe. It's also somehow capable of displaying holograms and detecting spacetime deformations. That's weird, considering that 001's universe was still nowhere near that kind of technology.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive θ - Universe 003</h2>
        <p class="text-start">Universe 003 is the place of birth of subject 003. This universe is approximately 66% smaller than the average universe, being universe -001 the average size. It is recommended not to travel in this universe due to the high possibility of being attacked by the natives.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive ι - The seal</h2>
        <p class="text-start">Subject 0̸̵̶̷̡̼̞͇̒͆̕͠0̴̸̶̷͉͚̙̻̿͑͋͊̀̚0̸̴̶̷̢̙̼͍̘͊͐̓͊̈́̚͜ was sealed in the middle of nowhere. A place devoid of matter, time and life. The four core members helped create this flawless seal that would stop subject 0̸̵̶̷̡̼̞͇̒͆̕͠0̴̸̶̷͉͚̙̻̿͑͋͊̀̚0̸̴̶̷̢̙̼͍̘͊͐̓͊̈́̚͜ from destroying any more worlds.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive κ - Core members</h2>
        <p class="text-start">There are 4 core members in total. They are the first ever Azaruses to be part of the Azarus Association. They are Lazarus, Colorzarus, [REDACTED] and, of course, me (Chronozarus). Each has their unique role in the association. Lazarus is our leader. With him in charge, we have been able to contain every dissonance in the interdimensional tissue. Colorzarus is a great mediator, so we tell him to intervene when there’s a discussion that’s gone too wild. [REDACTED] is the head of the research department. He has created all sorts of inventions: weapons, gadgets, chemicals and even tools. Finally, I am the writer of these Archives and head of the administration department.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive λ - [Access denied]</h2>
        <p class="text-start"><em>Some parts may be censored due to low tier access credentials.</em><br><br>Apparently, [REDACTED] has betrayed the association. After he left, we found a secret entrance that led to a lab that was experimenting with a [REDACTED] in live subjects. We later identified the substance to be [REDACTED] from the [REDACTED] universe after checking its universe signature. It has been written in some papers found inside that laboratory that [REDACTED] affects each individual in unique ways. Some experiment death, others present deformities and some can use it to their advantage. There have been cases where the subject completely accepts the [REDACTED] in their body, granting them abilities beyond their limitations without much of a drawback.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive μ - Lazarus's early life</h2>
        <p class="text-start">Lazarus was a normal person ever since he was conscious. One day just like any other day the war of embers broke out. As the government was recruiting soldiers, Lazarus had no choice but to enlist in the army. Thanks to having played many FPS games, he was granted a position as a sniper. At least he was safe from the chaos in the frontlines. During one mission in which he had to guard some sort of complex from anyone that tried to spy from afar, a large hole opened up in the ground, leading to what people called the depths. He was sent there to investigate and on many missions thereafter. Not much is known about what he's done in there, but when he returned he looked like he'd seen a lot of stuff. And somehow he had a cloak? Something was off with him. It was like he changed a lot in a short period of time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive ν - Alternate universes</h2>
        <p class="text-start">It has been recently discovered by the RIFT department that there are certain "special" universes. They do not correspond to any given canon, and get spontaneously created in the multiverse mesh. We are currently exploring the possible causes of these phenomena. It is not sure, but the most popular hypothesis going around that department is that there's some kind of elevated entity capable of creating universes at will. But it's just a theory nonetheless.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive ξ - Universe 002 black alert</h2>
        <p class="text-start">It seems the RIFT department was somewhat right. Those entities can not also create universes, but also delete them. We don't know the meaning of this action, if it is a declaration of war, mere entertainment, or they grew tired of it. If it is the latter, I fear that these entities will delete more universes if they grow tired of them. So we better keep being entertaining to them. Whatever it may be, Subject 002 will not be able to return to his original universe. The entities rampaged on it, so there's not much left of it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive ο - Lazarus</h2>
        <p class="text-start">One of the core founders of the Association, he leads all the efforts to maintain the balance of the multiverse.<br><br>It's unknown what type of entity he is (or became), as he holds certain superhuman powers. He's native of the "Sep" universe, which at the time was an absolute mess. Even though he tried to keep himself out of the big fights during the war, he was eventually forced into it to survive. Not long after, he found out of the happenings described in Archive α. Feeling guilty, he left the war and spent months secluded developing a tool to travel universes. He eventually joined forces with the other 3 core members, creating what's known as the Azarus Association.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive π - Cult Of Flour</h2>
        <p class="text-start">A cult, created by Innocence. They worship the <em>Diety of Flour</em>, which doesn't appear to be our Subject 000 nor any other documented subject. We are unsure if this <em>diety</em> is a version of Azarus, an entity or a concept. This cult has knowledge of the other universes and seem to have special powers related to bread. It's not confirmed whether this cult can use their powers outside their constellation's universe. Two members of the Association have been dispatched to investigate and keep an eye on this cult while undercover.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width: 900px;">
        <h2>Archive ρ - Innocence's Anomaly</h2>
        <p class="text-start">It has been confirmed that the universe created by Innocence is anomalous. With our technology we detected that multiple life forms hold the Azarus ego. Furthermore, these life forms appear to be part of this Cult Of Flour. Whatever this entity is planning, it's going to mess with the canon if we let this universe develop naturally. The core has decided to contain this universe, making it impossible for any matter to escape by any means. If the cult ever tries to escape containment, our agents have been instructed to intervene in a destructive manner.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><em>Note from -001:</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>I might have to take matters into my own hands if this cult tries to mess with the canon.</em></li>
