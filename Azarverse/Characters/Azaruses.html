        <h2>Subject τ - Inkzarus</h2>
        <p>John was furious that Azarus saw his official lab documents and decided to exact his revenge. He saw what brimferro did to the Victor drawing, so he decided to draw Azarus in an attempt to make a clone. But when he went to add the brimferro, the vial shattered and spilled all over the drawing. This led to Inkzarus being born in a strangely obedient state. His behavior is like that of a Rottweiler, obedient and caring yet strong and aggressive. <br><br>His favorite bread is cinnamon raisin</p>
